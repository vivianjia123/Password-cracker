# Password-cracker

In this project, we will try to crack the passwords of a simple system that has four- and six-character passwords. The passwords can contain any ASCII character from 32 (space) to 126 (~), but since the passwords are chosen by people, they are not arbitrary strings. This system is particularly insecure because it will accept any of the thirty previous passwords of the user. Our goal is to write code to guess as many of these as possible.

The specific requirement is described in [Project 2](https://github.com/vivianjia123/Password-cracker/blob/main/password_cracker_v3.pdf).
